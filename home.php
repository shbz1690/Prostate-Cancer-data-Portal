                       <font color="blue"> Prostate cancer</font> is the most common type of cancer found in American men, other than
                        skin cancer. About 1 man in 7 will get prostate cancer during his lifetime.<br /><br />
                       <font color="blue"> Prostate cancer</font> is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, behind only lung
                        cancer. About 1 man in 38 will die of this disease.<br /><br />
                       <font color="blue"> Prostate cancer </font>can be a serious disease, but most men found to have prostate cancer do
                        not die from it. In fact, more than 2.9 million men in the United States who have had
                       prostate cancer at some point are still alive today<br /><br />
                        There are several types of cells in the prostate, but nearly all prostate cancers start in the
                         gland cells. This kind of cancer is known as <font color="blue">adenocarcinoma</font>. The rest of the
                         information here refers only to prostate adenocarcinoma. <br /><br />
